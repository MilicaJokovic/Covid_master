Master thesis regarding the most prominent sociodemographic factors for mortality rate in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the USA.

**WORK OBJECTIVES**

The main objective of this work is to identify the most significant socio-demographic predictors that occur during the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States. Within this framework:
• Consolidation and processing of data relevant to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA.
• Determination of the severity measure of COVID-19 progression at the county level in the United States.
• Utilization of the mentioned measure as a dependent variable in two regression methods based on regularization, in order to identify the most significant risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 progression from a large number of potential predictors.
