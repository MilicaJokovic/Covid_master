Master thesis regarding the most prominent sociodemographic factors for mortality rate in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the USA.

**WORK OBJECTIVES**

The main objective of this work is to identify the most significant socio-demographic predictors that occur during the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States. Within this framework:

• Consolidation and processing of data relevant to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA.

• Determination of the severity measure of COVID-19 progression at the county level in the United States.

• Utilization of the mentioned measure as a dependent variable in two regression methods based on regularization, in order to identify the most significant risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 progression from a large number of potential predictors.

Representation of the most influential variables on the measure of disease progression severity in the form of scatter plots. The y-axis represents the measure of disease progression severity. On the x-axis, selected predictors of progression severity are presented: A) the total number of deaths in the USA in 2019; B) the female population aged 65 and older; C) Adults who are smokers, and D) Uninsured children. In the top left corner of each graph, the correlation coefficient R and the P-value are indicated.
